# PT_BiographParser

This module parses the daily QC report (XML format) generated by the Siemens biograph TOF PET-CT.   
To send the data from the scanner to wadqc a separate tool has to be installed on the scanner, that can be found [here]( https://github.com/MedPhysQC/Tools/tree/master/PET_Siemens_send2wad).
